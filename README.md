Hi there, i’m a brazilian **MSc student in Machine Learning**, at University of São Paulo (USP), Brazil. I research cool **NLP** applications at [C2D lab](http://www.wcss2014.pcs.usp.br/), in particular _seq2seq_ generation strategies, but I´m also very interested in other Machine Learning applications.

## 

- I’m currently working on [PLSum](https://github.com/aseidelo/wiki_generator), a framework for _seq2seq_ summarization in Brazilian Portuguese, using Transformers networks.

- A previous publication on a simmilar topic is [here] (https://github.com/aseidelo/MD-ASES).

- Always looking to collaborate on new projects ⚡
