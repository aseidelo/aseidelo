### Hi there, I’m a Brazilian programmer, specialized in Machine Learning

At the moment, I’m a **MSc computer engineering student at University of São Paulo (USP)**, Brazil. I research cool **NLP** applications at [C2D lab](http://www.wcss2014.pcs.usp.br/), in particular _seq2seq_ generation strategies. I´m also very interested in other technological stuff, such as robotics, embedded systems, and Netflix. 

## 

- I’m currently working on [wiki_generator](https://github.com/aseidelo/wiki_generator), a framework for _seq2seq_ summarization in Brazilian Portuguese, using Transformers networks. A previous already published work on a simmilar topic is [MD-ASES](https://github.com/aseidelo/MD-ASES).

- Always looking to collaborate on new projects ⚡
